# Relational-Database

For these courses, I use real developer tools and software including VS Code, PostgreSQL, and the Linux / Unix command line to complete interactive tutorials and build projects.

These courses start off with basic Bash commands. Using the terminal, I learn everything from navigating and manipulating a file system, scripting in Bash, all the way to advanced usage.

Next, how to create and use a relational database with PostgreSQL, a database management system, and SQL, the language of these databases.

Finally, learn Git, the version control system, an essential tool of every developer.

## Learn Bash by Building a Boilerplate
The terminal allows you to send text commands to your computer that can manipulate the file system, run programs, automate tasks, and much more.

In this 170-lesson course, you will learn terminal commands by creating a website boilerplate using only the command line.

## Learn Relational Databases by Building a Mario Database
A relational database organizes data into tables that are linked together through relationships.

In this 165-lesson course, you will learn the basics of a relational database by creating a PostgreSQL database filled with video game characters.

* Build a Mario Database --- [Done](_.md)

## Celestial Bodies Database
This is one of the required projects to earn  certification.

For this project, you will build a database of celestial bodies using PostgreSQL.

* Build a Celestial Bodies Database --- [Done](_.md)

## Learn Bash Scripting by Building Five Programs
Bash scripts combine terminal commands and logic into programs that can execute or automate tasks, and much more.

In this 220-lesson course, you will learn more terminal commands and how to use them within Bash scripts by creating five small programs.

* Build Five Programs --- [Done](_.md)

## Learn SQL by Building a Student Database: Part 1
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is the language for communicating with a relational database.

In this 140-lesson course, you will create a Bash script that uses SQL to enter information about your computer science students into PostgreSQL.

* Build a Student Database: Part 1 --- [Done](_.md)

## Learn SQL by Building a Student Database: Part 2
SQL join commands are used to combine information from multiple tables in a relational database

In this 140-lesson course, you will complete your student database while diving deeper into SQL commands.

* Build a Student Database: Part 2 --- [Done](_.md)

## World Cup Database
This is one of the required projects to earn your certification.

For this project, you will create a Bash script that enters information from World Cup games into PostgreSQL, then query the database for useful statistics.

* Build a World Cup Database --- [Done](_.md)

## Learn Advanced Bash by Building a Kitty Ipsum Translator
There's more to Bash commands than you might think.

In this 140-lesson course, you will learn some more complex commands, and the details of how commands work.

* Build a Kitty Ipsum Translator --- [Done](_.md)

## Learn Bash and SQL by Building a Bike Rental Shop
In this 210-lesson course, you will build an interactive Bash program that stores rental information for your bike rental shop using PostgreSQL.

* Build a Bike Rental Shop --- [Done](_.md)

## Salon Appointment Scheduler
This is one of the required projects to earn your certification.

For this project, you will create an interactive Bash program that uses PostgreSQL to track the customers and appointments for your salon.

* Build a Salon Appointment Scheduler --- [Done](_.md)

## Learn Nano by Building a Castle
Nano is a program that allows you to edit files right in the terminal.

In this 40-lesson course, you will learn how to edit files in the terminal with Nano while building a castle.

* Build a Castle --- [Done](_.md)

## Learn Git by Building an SQL Reference Object
Git is a version control system that keeps track of all the changes you make to your codebase.

In this 240-lesson course, you will learn how Git keeps track of your code by creating an object containing commonly used SQL commands.

* Build an SQL Reference Object --- [Done](_.md)

## Periodic Table Database
This is one of the required projects to earn your certification.

For this project, you will create Bash a script to get information about chemical elements from a periodic table database.

* Build a Periodic Table Database --- [Done](_.md)

## Number Guessing Game
This is one of the required projects to earn your certification.

For this project, you will use Bash scripting, PostgreSQL, and Git to create a number guessing game that runs in the terminal and saves user information.

* Build a Number Guessing Game --- [Done](_.md)

## Prerequisites

1. [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)
1. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension
1. Git

## How to Run a Project in Docker

1. Clone the RDB Alpha repo with `git clone https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/rdb-alpha`
1. Open a terminal, navigate to the `rdb-alpha` directory, and open VSCode with `code .`
1. Press Ctrl / Cmd + Shift + P and enter `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container and Reopen in Container`
1. A new VS Code window will open and begin building the Docker image. It will take several minutes to build the first time.
1. Once the image is finished building, press Ctrl / Cmd + Shift + P and enter `CodeRoad: Start` to open CodeRoad
1. In the CodeRoad window, click "Start New Tutorial"
1. Enter the URL to the `tutorial.json` file of the project you want to start (ex: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/learn-bash-by-building-a-boilerplate/main/tutorial.json)
1. Click the "Start" button

There may be some additional troubleshooting steps to get the container running properly. They can often be solved by following the onscreen instructions, or examining any error messages in your terminal.

## How to Restart or Switch Projects

Note: If you restart or switch projects you will lose your progress, along with any files or directories you created.

1. Press Ctrl / Cmd + Shift + P and enter `Dev Containers: Rebuild Container`
1. Wait for VS Code to reopen and reload the Docker container
1. Open CodeRoad, enter the URL to a `tutorial.json` file, and start the project as described above
